# Gibbons Lab

[Our lab](https://gibbons.isbscience.org/) is located at the [Institute for Systems Biology](https://isbscience.org/) in Seattle, Washigton. We are interested in the ecology, evolution, and emergent function of host-microbial systems. The [team](https://gibbons.isbscience.org/people/current/) is led by [Dr. Sean Gibbons](https://gibbons.isbscience.org/bio/sean-gibbons-phd/). Our toolset includes ecological and evolutionary theory, applied math and biostatistics, and computational systems biology. Most of our work is within the computtional domain, but we occaisionally run our own experiments. Our fundamental aim is to discover and formalize the biological rule sets governing host-microbe systems, and apply these rules to engineer microbial ecoystems to improve human and environmental health.
